MAD!

How could cordova not handling icons & splash as its API document describles?

Official document on [Icons and Splash Screens](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.3.0/config_ref_images.md.html#Icons%20and%20Splash%20Screens)


It drove me crazy! That's why this cordova-mad repo is here with my first hook for cordova. 


Inspired by [icons_and_splash.js](https://gist.github.com/apla/6179863), thanks - [apla](https://gist.github.com/apla)
